MASM Language Definition 
------------------------

**For Sublime Text and Textmate(sort of)**


This is attempt at making a semy decent definition for MASM.
It is VERY far from complete and only works for very basic stuff.

Since I am in Assembly class and we have to use masm I decided to
write this definition up and add to it as I go through my class. This is why it is incomplete.

That said if anyone is willing to help me in making this... GREAT!
However I do not see much use for this since (dare I say) no one in their right mind
would be programming anything in assembly for windows...
